# Hi there 👋

My name is Iyiola Adedeji and I am mainly a mobile app developer (I'm also a graphics designer, but more on that later 😉). I am mostly focused on Flutter.

## 📱 Product Design
I am also currently learning about UI/UX Design and will be updating this with projects I have completed in the near future.
Hoping to be able to work in the game industry, creating beautiful UIs and a great UX for video games 😁

<b>Thank you for your time!</b>
